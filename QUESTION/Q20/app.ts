//Q20:- Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Create an array of mountains
let mountains: string[] = ["Everest", "K2", "Kangchenjunga", "Lhotse", "Makalu"];
// Print the array of mountains
console.log("List of mountains:", mountains);

for (const top of mountains) {
    console.log(top);
}
