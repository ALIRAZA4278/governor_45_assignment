//Q20:- Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Create an array of mountains
var mountains = ["Everest", "K2", "Kangchenjunga", "Lhotse", "Makalu"];
// Print the array of mountains
console.log("List of mountains:", mountains);
for (var _i = 0, mountains_1 = mountains; _i < mountains_1.length; _i++) {
    var top_1 = mountains_1[_i];
    console.log(top_1);
}
